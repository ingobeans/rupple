rupple is a repl for rust! i made it because [evcxr](https://github.com/evcxr/evcxr), the only other rust repl i know about, is really slow (at least on my machine), requires rust nightly, has a shitload of dependencies, and simply refuses to run on one of my computers.

rupple features:
* run rust code in repl environment with output
* roughly 5x faster than evcxr on my machine
* no nightly required
* 2 deps only

install: `cargo install --git https://github.com/ingobeans/rupple.git`
